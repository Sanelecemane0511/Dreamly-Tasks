# Dreamly-Tasks
**Angular Task Management Application**

## Project Description
Dreamly-Tasks is a productivity app created with Angular. It allows users to create, organize, and track their daily goals in a fast and responsive interface.

## Technical Skills Used
* **Framework:** Angular (TypeScript).
* **Frontend:** HTML5 and CSS3.
* **Architecture:** Component-based development.
* **Tools:** Angular CLI and VS Code.

## Main Features
* **Dynamic Task Lists:** Users can add and remove tasks without the page reloading.
* **State Management:** I used Angular’s data-binding to ensure the UI stays updated with the latest user input.
* **Responsive Layout:** The app is designed to look good on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technical Challenge Solved
I faced a problem where the task data was being lost whenever the page refreshed. I solved this by implementing **Local Storage** logic. This allows the browser to save the user's tasks locally, so their data is still there even if they close the tab or refresh the page.# CulinaryAdventures
**ASP.NET Core and C# Web Application**

## Project Description
CulinaryAdventures is a web platform built for food lovers to share and discover recipes. This project demonstrates my ability to use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to create a clean and organized web application.

## Technical Skills Used
* **Backend:** C# and ASP.NET Core.
* **Database:** Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
* **Tools:** Visual Studio Code and Git.

## Main Features
* **Recipe Management:** Users can browse different food categories and view detailed recipes.
* **Dynamic Content:** The application pulls recipe data from a SQL database.
* **Clean UI:** Designed a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate through culinary content.

## Technical Challenge Solved
While building the recipe display page, I had a problem where the images were not loading correctly from the database paths. I fixed this by updating the "Static File" configuration in the Program.cs file. This ensured that all recipe images showed up instantly, creating a much better experience for the user.
